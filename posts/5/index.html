<h1>Rails page caching for improved performance</h1>

<p><p>In order to reduce the load on your server and allow more concurrent users to hit your website, you may use caching. There are many types of caching in Ruby on Rails, some of which are discussed in the guides. Some require the use of a dedicated caching service such as AWS’s Elasticache (memcache or redis). The minimum cost of one of those instances is the same as a t2 micro. If you are only running a simple Rails app, this service may not be worth it, especially since there is a simple method of caching that doesn’t cost anything extra and provides an immense speed boost in many situations. This is described in the Rails guides as page caching, and while it was removed the Rails core since Rails 4, there is still a handy gem that provide the same functionality called actionpack-page_caching. This caching creates a html only snapshot of your rails page, and allows it to be rendered by only Nginx or Apache, which should be much faster. I personally installed in on my own rails blog (this site) using the instructions and here are the results (I did this test with Apache Bench -&gt; I ran</p>

<p>ab -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:3000/</p>

<p>where 3000 is the local reverse forwarding port of my Nginx server</p>

<p>Before this change, here are the results</p>
