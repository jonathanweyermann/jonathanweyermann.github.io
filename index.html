        <h3>Streamlining App Development: Exploring the Features of the Government of Alberta Platform</h3>
        <p>The Government of Alberta platform team is developing a number of features for their platform, including a platform dashboard for monitoring application downtime. They are also creating a range of services that can be easily integrated into applications and services. These services include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access: This allows for secure sign-in with minimal configuration and user authentication.</li>
  <li>Calendar: This service manages dates and times in a specific timezone and provides information about calendars, events, and scheduling.</li>
  <li>Configuration: This provides a generic JSON document store for storage and revisioning of infrequently changing configuration.</li>
  <li>Directory: This is a registry of services and APIs that applications can use to look up URLs for services.</li>
  <li>Event: This provides tenant applications with the ability to send domain events and leverage additional capabilities as side effects.</li>
  <li>File: This service provides the capability to upload and download files with role-based access policy.</li>
  <li>Notification: This service allows for the configuration of notifications in tenant applications.</li>
  <li>PDF: This provides PDF operations like generating new PDFs from templates and uploading the output PDF files to the file service.</li>
  <li>Script: This provides the ability to execute configured Lua scripts for capturing simple logic in configuration.</li>
  <li>Status: This allows for easy monitoring of application downtime.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, these services provide a range of capabilities for easy integration into applications and services, with the aim of improving efficiency and productivity.</p>
